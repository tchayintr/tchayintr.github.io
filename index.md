# Thodsaporn Chay-intr's Homepage

I am a recent Doctoral graduate in Engineering from the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), Japan, where I had the honor of contributing to the [Okumura-Funakoshi Lab](https://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/). Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree in Engineering from the Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology at Thammasat University, Thailand. 

My academic path has been distinctly defined by a deep-rooted engagement in cutting-edge engineering practices and research, with a particular focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the progression from traditional methodologies to modern advancements in Machine Learning.


## Recent Updates
- [2023-12-04] I have received the distinguished invitation to join the [Intelligent Informatics and Service Innovation (IISI) Research Center](https://saki.siit.tu.ac.th/downloads/iisi/IISI-ResearchCenter-2014-v02%20(1).pdf) in Thailand as a visiting researcher.
