## Work Experience
- **Machine Learning Researcher and Lecture** <br>Artificial Intelligence Association of Thailand, Thailand, 2018 - 2023  
    - Designed and delivered Python courses on data analysis, AI, and ML. Covered tools (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, spacy) and algorithms (e.g., regression, SVM, neural nets) in text and image analysis to educate hundreds of students, cultivating ML enthusiasts in Thailand.
    - Consulted industries and students on theoretical and practical ML concepts, guiding project plans, assisting in the development of projects and software, and contributing to the publication of over 10 international research papers and projects.
- **Research Assistant** <br>Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, 2019 - 2020
    - Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to implement tailored APIs for NLU/NLG units for Japanese conversational dialogs.
    - Designed, developed, and applied LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence models using PyTorch for text generation and refinement, resulting in enhanced fluency and a more natural linguistic output, validated through human evaluations.
- **Machine Learning Engineer, Software Engineer, and Researcher** <br>iApp Technology Limited, Thailand, 2017 - 2018
    - Spearheaded and led a cross-disciplinary team of linguists and software developers to construct the first Thai Treebank, comprising over 5,000 entries, contributing Thai NLP resources, enhancing research, innovations, and applications in the NLP community.
    - Led the development and deployment of native and web applications in React, Python, and GCP, as a pipeline product, for syntactic extraction stored in Firestore, with an emphasis on intuitive UX, bolstering ongoing developments in the Thai NLP community.

## Selected Projects
- **A Unification-based Knowledge Graph Construction for Thai Profile Generation from Online Resources** (2023)
    - Constructed a knowledge graph for Thai researchers, using 6+ million entries crawled from online research databases.
    - Designed a semi-supervised method with multi-task learning to extract entities/relations, improving F1-score by 8% over baseline.
- **Simple2In1:A Simple Method for Fusing Two Sequences from Different Captioning Systemsinto One Sequence** (2023)
    - Developed a T5-based generative model for Thai captions fusion, outperforming baselines by 5.2% in sBLEU and ROUGE-L scores.
    - Accomplished a sBLEU score of 79% and a ROUGE-L score of 90% for a small captioning dataset comprising 3,168 samples.
- **LATTE: Lattice ATTentive Encoding for Character-based Word Segmentation** (2023)
    - Proposed, and implemented a sequence labelling method that integrates multi-granularity linguistic units, Lattices, GNNs, PTMs, and Attention Mechanism using PyTorch and PyG to generate and refine text representations for word segmentation.
    - Achieved state-of-the-art performance (97.7% to 99.4% of F1-score) across Asian languages: Japanese, Chinese, and Thai.
- **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Using Multiple Labels from Different Modalities** (2023)
    - Collaborated with students to design and implement a sentiment analysis model for social network data, leveraging text, image, and multimodal labels using CLIP, BERT, and RoBERTa. Yielded up to 2% improvement in F1-score over recent models.
    - Attained F1-scores of 74.1% for MVSA-single and 62.0% MVSA-multiple datasets.
- **Detecting Fraud Job Recruitment Using Features Reflecting from Real-world Knowledge of Fraud** (2022)
    - Developed a method to classify fake job recruitments using a set of novel features designed to reflect fraudster behaviors.
    - Yielded accuracy of 97.64% for Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD).
- **Public Budget Usage Monitoring System** (2019)
    - Cooperated with an interdisciplinary team to develop a monitoring system that utilizes Scrapy to crawl large-scale unstructured data from government sites, such as procurement and budget portals, for corruption detection in text data. Deployed by two organizations.
    - Developed a text classification method in TensorFlow, with rule-based enhancements, for corruption detection, validated by experts.
    - Obtained Bronze Medal in The 47th International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva
