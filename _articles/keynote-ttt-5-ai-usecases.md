# 5 AI Use Cases that have been already Applied in Thai Businesses

I am exited to share what I talked about in '5 AI Use Cases in Thai Businesses.' This comes from my experience working closely with clients to provide consultation and solve their problems using AI. The focus is on leveraging suitable, advanced, and recent AI to automate systems, enhancing services and operational efficiency.

In this talk, the spotlight is on five key AI technologies: Chatbots, Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech-to-Text (ASR), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Face Recognition. These tools are already making big changes in Thai companies. They help improve how work is done, making things better and faster. These technologies are not just important now; they're starting to shape the future of business in Thailand, showing how companies can improve their services and work more efficiently.
